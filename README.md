Source Code for Pluralsight's Node Application Patterns Course
===========================================

This is the source code for Tekpub's old Node Application Patterns course, which was migrated to Pluralsight in the fall of 2013. I have forked this code to change the implementation of the registration module to use js-signals instead of the event emitter for events. Using to demonstrate js-signals package.
